# Packetanalyzer
This tool gives a few options for different data analysis tools for a pcap file.
You may need to install sudo apt install python3-scapy at least in my case.

Steps

1. Download the script and any independcies for example I needed.
   install sudo apt install python3-scapy
2. Specify the path to your file you can go to its directory and type "pwd"
3. Run the script with the pcap
